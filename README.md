## Project Details

The goal of this project is quite simple. We want to be able to provide a platform for players to see the best (aka as the most powerful) cards in the game. Therefore you can see the list of the most powerful cards (all the cards with a power above above 8) and also display some more details about this card. This is part of a school homework.

## Project Technologies

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It also uses packages like Material UI for styling, mswjs for mocking the data, cypress & jest for testing purposes as well as framer-motion for animations and backstopjs to automate visual regression.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies of the project by running :

```bash
npm install
# or

then, run the development server:

```bash

```

Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) with your browser to see the result.
