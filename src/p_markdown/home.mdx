        ## Game Market

        <Typography variant='body1' component='div' sx={{ mb: 5 }}>
            New cards are released on a regular basis through expansion sets. Further developments include the Wizards Play
            Network played at the international level and the worldwide community Players Tour, as well as a substantial resale
            market for Magic cards. Certain cards can be valuable due to their rarity in production and utility in gameplay,
            with prices ranging from a few cents to tens of thousands of dollars. The market for Magic: The Gathering is dominated by the online multiplayer service Discord.
            The game is also available on the iOS and Android platforms.

        ## The Project
        <Typography variant='body1' component='div' sx={{ mb: 5 }}>
            The goal of this project is quite simple. We want to be able to provide a platform for players to see the best (aka as the most powerful) cards in the game. As an example you can see "**Emrakul, the Promised End**" which is considered as the absolute best card of the game with its power of 13. This legendary piece comes from the ***Eldritch Moon*** expansion set.
